_This is a stripped down text version of the video [Java Interfaces Explained](https://youtu.be/BrUuDnmtvK8). The video has many more examples and in depth explanations._

In this guide, we'll delve into the concept of interfaces in Java, exploring their significance and practical applications through real-world examples.
Whether you're new to Java or seeking to deepen your understanding of this fundamental concept, this guide is designed to offer valuable insights for all levels of expertise.

## What is an Interface?

An interface in Java acts as a contract or blueprint for a class.
It specifies _what_ a class must do, but not _how_ it does it.


For instance, consider this interface `Playable`, which includes a method `play`.
This method has no body, leaving the implementation details to the classes that will use this interface.

```java
public interface Playable {
    void play();
}
```

The naming convention for interfaces often includes suffixes like *-able* or *-ible*, such as `Renderable`, `Comparable`, or `Playable`.
Sometimes, interfaces are named after a property they represent, like `HasSize`, or simply as nouns like `List` or `Set`.

We can have different implementations of this interface, like `Video` and `Audio`, each defining its own version of `play`:

```java
public class Video implements Playable {
    @Override
    public void play() {
        // play the video
    }
}

public class Audio implements Playable {
    @Override
    public void play() {
        // play the audio
    }
}
```

## Why Use Interfaces?

Interfaces allow for writing implementation-agnostic code, meaning the code doesn't rely on the specific details of how each class accomplishes its tasks.

This approach offers numerous benefits:

1. **Reduced Coupling:** By using interfaces, classes become less dependent on each other's specifics, enhancing flexibility and modularity in the code.
2. **Code Reusability:** Interfaces enable multiple classes to implement the same set of behaviors in different ways, promoting code reuse.
3. **Enhanced Scalability:** They allow systems to scale and evolve over time, accommodating new functionalities without disrupting existing implementations.

Imagine a `Player` class that can play any `Playable` object.
This design allows us to pass any object that implements `Playable`, such as `Video` or `Audio`, to the `Player` class without it needing to know the specifics of these classes.

```java
public class Player {
    void play(Playable playable) {
        playable.play();
    }
}
```

### Java 8 Interface Features

With Java 8, interfaces gained additional capabilities, moving closer to abstract classes.

Let's explore some of these advanced features:

1. **Default Methods:** Interfaces can now include methods with a default implementation, allowing shared functionality among implementing classes.
2. **Static Methods:** Like static methods in classes, these are attached to the interface and can be accessed without an instance.
3. **Functional Interfaces:** These special interfaces with a single abstract method can be implemented using lambda expressions or method references.

#### Default Methods

With Java 8, interfaces were enhanced with the ability to have default methods.
These are methods within an interface that have a default implementation.
This feature allows for greater flexibility and the ability to add new functionality to interfaces without breaking existing implementations.

```java
public interface Logger {
    void log(String message);

    default void logError(String message) {
        log("ERROR: " + message);
    }
}
```

In this example, `Logger` interface has a default method `logError` that utilizes the `log` method.
Implementing classes can override this default method if a specific behavior is required.

#### Static Methods

Java 8 also introduced the possibility of defining static methods in interfaces.
These methods are attached to the interface itself and not to the object instances, similar to static methods in classes.

```java
public interface UserStore {
    void putUser(User user);
    User getUser(String username);
    
    static String getDefaultUsername() {
        return System.getProperty("user.name");
    }
}
```

Here, `UserStore` interface contains a static method `getDefaultUsername`.
This method can be accessed without creating an instance of the interface, using `UserStore.getDefaultUsername()`.

#### Functional Interfaces

A significant feature introduced in Java 8 is the concept of functional interfaces.
A functional interface is an interface with exactly one abstract method, and it can be used alongside lambda expressions and method references.

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface Processor {
    void process(String data);
}
```

This `Processor` interface is a functional interface.
It can be implemented using a lambda expression:

```java
Processor processor = data -> System.out.println(data);
```

Or a method reference:

```java
Processor processor = System.out::println;
```

Functional interfaces are a key part of Java's lambda expressions, allowing for concise and expressive code.

### Advanced Features of Java Interfaces: Inheritance, Extension, and Generics

Advanced features like interface inheritance, extending interfaces, and generic interfaces further enhance the capability and flexibility of interfaces in Java.

#### Interface Inheritance

Java interfaces support the concept of inheritance, similar to classes.
One interface can extend another, inheriting its methods.
This allows for a more modular and structured approach to interface design.

Extending interfaces allows for adding new functionality to an existing interface without altering the original interface's contract.
This is particularly useful for maintaining backward compatibility.

```java
public interface Logger {
    void log(String message);
}

public interface ErrorLogger extends Logger {
    void logError(String errorMessage);
}
```

`ErrorLogger` extends `Logger`, adding a new method `logError`, while still maintaining the original `log` method from `Logger`.

#### Generic Interfaces

Interfaces in Java can be generic, allowing for type parameters.
This makes interfaces more flexible and reusable, as they can be used with various data types.

```java
public interface Store<T> {
    void put(T item);
    T get(int id);
}
```

The `Store` interface is a generic interface with a type parameter `T`.
This allows for the creation of repositories for different data types, like `Store<Integer>` or `Store<User>`.
