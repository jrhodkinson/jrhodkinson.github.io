If you're still thinking in terms of clean code, then you're focusing on the wrong things. Here's what actually matters:

## 1. Solve the Right Problems, Not Every Problem

Prioritise tasks that have an **exponential ROI** over polishing rarely used features.

## 2. Think in Business Impact

Frame decisions in terms of **revenue, user engagement, and metrics specific to your business**.  
Communicate in **stakeholder language** and focus on problems that move the needle on your business’s key metrics.

## 3. Prioritise Deep Work at All Costs

Development is hugely taxing on our brains, and in my experience, it can take **upwards of half an hour to get into the zone** where you're actually producing something of value.
- Allocate **large stretches of time** where all you're doing is focusing on **hard problems and their solutions**.
- Consider setting a personal rule that you **don’t accept meetings before noon**.
- Set your phone to **Do Not Disturb** mode.

---

## 4. Ship First, Refine Never

Write **good enough code** that solves a user's problem and **only optimise when metrics demand it**.  
Too often, we're focused on **perfectionism or premature optimisation**, which prevents getting our code in the hands of users quickly.
- Identify the **critical components** of your feature.
- Deliver **only those** to the user.
- Users just want to **click the button, do the thing, and move on**—anything else is **wasting time**.

---

## 5. Become a Force Multiplier for Your Team

- Build **documentation, processes, and internal tools** that scale your team's impact 10x.
- **Script anything** that can be automated.
- **Eliminate manual work aggressively**.

---

## 6. Steal Code Mercilessly

- Don't build things in-house if an **open-source library** will do the trick.
- If another team in your company provides a **service or platform** you can leverage, do so.
- **Value speed over originality.**

---

## 7. Don't Solve Problems—Remove Them

- Eliminate **root causes** rather than just treating symptoms.
- Design **systems or processes** that prevent problems from occurring in the first place.
- Make **impossible states unrepresentable** in your code—for example, by **leveraging type systems or constraints in relational databases**.

---

## 8. Master Meta-Skills Over Syntax

- Focus on **transferable skills** rather than language specifics.
- **Prototyping, debugging, and problem decomposition** will serve you well regardless of your stack.
- Learn how to **use AI tools effectively**.

---

## 9. Build Slack Into Estimates

Unexpected problems always occur, so it’s good to have a **buffer** to resolve them without having to reorganise the whole project.  
And if you **do** end up with extra time:
- **Improve code quality.**
- **Create documentation.**
- **Build internal tools.**

---

## 10. Create Strategic Alliances

- Cultivate **relationships with key stakeholders** who can support you when needed.
- Create **shields** around organisational chaos to protect your team’s **deep work**.
- Learn as much as you can about how your **industry works from a non-technical perspective**.
