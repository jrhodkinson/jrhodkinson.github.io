Non-technical people are not idiots.
Respect them.
Understand that whilst you will have to dumb down (?) technical concepts, you mustn't have to dumb down everything.
For instance, business people (?) are completely capable of understanding XYZ.

Don't get into the weeds.
There's no point, they won't understand them / remember them.

Start with the key takeaway (this goes for any message).
Why are you explaining this to them at all?

Do you _need_ to explain anything?
Can you leverage trust / reputation to skip an awkward explanation?

Don't explain everything, pick the important things.

Use analogies to everyday things.
